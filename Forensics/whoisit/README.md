# Who is it

We are given a file called email-export.eml . 

I saw an IP address in the “ARC-Authentication-Results” section, which was 173.249.33.206 .


I then conducted a WHOIS search on this IP address, using whois 173.249.33.206 ,

I saw that the “person” field was Wilhelm Zwalina . The email’s mail server originates from here.





Therefore, the flag is

picoCTF{WilhelmZwalina}
