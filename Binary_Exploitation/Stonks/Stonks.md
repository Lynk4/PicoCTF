# STONKS

AUTHOR: MADSTACKS

## Description:
I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c nc mercury.picoctf.net 16439

## Solution:

connect to pico ctf using the port 16439

We will attempt inputting %x as a proof of concept to test if the vulnerability is functional after choosing to "Buy some stonks," which triggers our vulnerability. Data from the stack will be printed out and shown in hex values using the %x format.

Even after changing the data's endianness from little to big, the flag still doesn't appear correct.

The values of the following bytes may be impacted by one byte. I began by deleting the hex values at the beginning.

Doing so, reveals the flag
